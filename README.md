1. HTML Document Structure
The document is a complete web page structured using semantic HTML elements such as <section>, <nav>, and <footer>.
It contains links to external stylesheets (Font Awesome for icons and a custom stylesheet project1.css).
The page is divided into several sections:
Navigation Bar: Includes links to different sections of the website.
Showcase Area: Displays a call-to-action with a "Menu" button.
About Us Section: Describes the restaurant's history and displays an image.
Types of Food Section: Showcases different food categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains, meat, seafood), each with an image and a link to more information.
Food Menu Section: Lists 12 food items, each with a description, image, price, and a title. Clicking an item could trigger a searchFood JavaScript function (which should handle some event for the selected food).
Testimonials Section: Displays two customer reviews with star ratings and quotes. The photos of Ritik Tiwari and Shreya Dubey are featured here.
Contact Section: Contains a contact form where users can submit their names, email, and a message. There are also social media icons linking to the restaurant’s social profiles.
Footer: Includes copyright information and credits Ritik Tiwari.
2. Important Features
Responsive Navbar: The navigation bar includes a hamburger menu for mobile devices, enhancing the site's responsiveness.
Font Awesome Icons: The social media icons in the contact section use Font Awesome for visual appeal.
Menu Items: Food items in the menu section are interactive (onclick="searchFood(event)") and designed with a structured layout to display the dish name, description, and price.
Testimonials: Displays customer feedback with photos, names, and a 5-star rating using the Font Awesome star icons.
Contact Form: A simple form for users to submit queries or feedback.
3. Styling and Layout
External styling (project1.css) handles layout, fonts, colors, and positioning.
Images are integrated throughout the site to add visual appeal and context (e.g., food types, testimonials).
4. JavaScript
A reference to project1.js is included at the bottom. Presumably, this file manages dynamic behaviors like the hamburger menu or form handling (though it’s not included here).
5. Social Media Integration
The social icons link to Ritik Tiwari’s personal profiles on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, GitHub, and LinkedIn, making the contact section more engaging.
6. Footer
The footer section gives credit to the website owner and restates the copyright information.
Key Takeaways:
The website is designed for a restaurant, promoting its menu, food types, and customer reviews.
It includes modern web development practices like responsive design (mobile-friendly navigation), icon libraries (Font Awesome), and external links to social media.
